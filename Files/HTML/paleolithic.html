    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Paleolithic Era was also known as the Old Stone Age</p>
    <img src="../Images/palartimg1.jpg" alt="Paleolithic cave art scene">
    <p>Took place around approximately 2.6 millions years ago which is back the year of roughly 10,000 BC. This period marks the earliest stage of human development and represents a very important chapter in human evolution.</p>
    <p>During this time, early humans developed the first stone tools(hence being called the stone age),learned how to control fire, and began to create art. This art was very special and can still be seen in some caves to this day, an example of the cave art can be seen as below. </p>

    <h3>Lascaux Cave, France</h3>
    <p>Discovered in 1940, Lascaux contains over 600 paintings and 1,500 engravings. The cave paintings are estimated to be over 17,000 years old. The site is so important that a replica cave was created to preserve the original artwork.</p>

    <h3>Altamira Cave, Spain</h3>
    <p>Altamira is famous for its stunning bison paintings, created around 36,000 years ago. The paintings are so well-preserved that when first discovered, experts thought they were modern forgeries.</p>

    <h3>Chauvet Cave, France</h3>
    <p>Discovered in 1994, Chauvet contains some of the oldest known cave paintings, dating back over 30,000 years. The cave features paintings of lions, rhinos, and other animals that are incredibly detailed and sophisticated.</p>

    <h2>Preservation and Discovery</h2>
    <p>Many Paleolithic artifacts and artworks have survived for tens of thousands of years, but they require careful preservation.</p>

    <h3>Why Cave Art Survived</h3>
    <p>Cave paintings have survived because caves provide stable environments with constant temperature and humidity. The darkness and isolation of caves protected the artwork from damage.</p>

    <h3>Modern Discoveries</h3>
    <p>New Paleolithic sites continue to be discovered today. Modern technology like ground-penetrating radar helps archaeologists find hidden caves and artifacts.</p>
    <p>Each new discovery adds to our understanding of early human life and art. Scientists use carbon dating and other techniques to determine the age of artifacts.</p>

    <h3>Conservation Challenges</h3>
    <p>Preserving Paleolithic art is challenging. Human presence, changes in cave conditions, and natural processes can damage ancient paintings. Many famous caves are now closed to the public, with replicas created for visitors.</p>

    <h2>Tools and Technology of the Stone Age</h2>
    <p>Stone tools were the primary technology of the paleolithic people. These tools were essential for survival and were used for various tasks.</p>
    <h3>Common Tools</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Hand Axes - Multi purpose tools used for cutting and chopping</li>
        <li>Scrapers - Used for preparing animal hides</li>
        <li>Blades - Sharp cutting tools which were made from flint</li>
        <li>Spears - Essential hunting weapons</li>
        <li>Awls - Tools for piercing and creating holes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Tool making required skill and knowledge that was passed down through generations.</p>
    <p>The quality of tools grew significantly over the course of the Paleolithic era.</p>

    <h2>Legacy of the Paleolithic Era</h2>
    <p>The Paleolithic era set the stage for all human development that followed. The innovations and adaptions of the period enabled humans to spread across the globe and eventually develop agriculture and civilisation</p>
    <p>We learned through this era by the inspiring artwork of the Paleolithic people as the ventured to the early birth of art with the work of cave paintings and carvings.</p>
    <p>Today we continue to learn about this fascinating period through archaeological discoveries, cave art, and the study of the stone tools left behind by our ancestors.</p>
