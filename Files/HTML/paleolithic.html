    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Paleolithic Era was also known as the Old Stone Age</p>
    <p>Took place around approximately 2.6 millions years ago which is back the year of roughly 10,000 BC. This period marks the earliest stage of human development and represents a very important chapter in human evolution.</p>
    <p>During this time, early humans developed the first stone tools(hence being called the stone age),learned how to control fire, and began to create art. This art was very special and can still be seen in some caves to this day, an example of the cave art can be seen as below. </p>
