<h2>Classicism: What is it?</h2>
    <p>

    The aesthetics and ideals of ancient Greece and Rome served as the inspiration for the classical art movement. But these aren't the artistic creations of the actual Greek and Roman empires. This artwork was created later on in a comparable style.

            <h2>Classicism in Architecture</h2>
            <p>
                One of the most powerful manifestations of classicism was architecture. Greek temples and Roman public structures served as direct inspiration for the symmetry, columns, domes, and exact proportions used in building design.

            <p>
                The "Three Unities"—one location, one time, and one main action—were stringent guidelines that classicist theatre adhered to. plays that emphasised morality, respect, and restrained emotion.

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unity of Time:</strong> story occurs within 24 hours</li>
                <li><strong>Unity of Place:</strong> one setting</li>

            <p>
        The interiors of neoclassical theaters are physically structured around the "Three Unities" of Classical theatrical performance; the designs' symmetry and placement of the central stage, balcony, and audience create a single, unified performance space (Unity of Place) while the geometric control and symmetry create a direct line of sight to the on-going action within the theater (Unity of Action). The proportionate and controlled nature of the neoclassical theater design requires that the action occur in real-time as well as on a continuous basis, which reflects the classical ideal of a dramatic moment in itself (Unity of Time). Thus, the spatial arrangement of the neoclassical theaters and how they allow for and form the basis of the storytelling structure which epitomizes Classicist narratives represents a blending of moderation and balance that characterize all Classicist style storytelling.
