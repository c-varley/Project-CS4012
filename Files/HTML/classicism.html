<h2>Classicism: What is it?</h2>
    <p>
        The aesthetics and ideals of ancient Greece and Rome served as the inspiration for the classical art movement. But these aren't the artistic creations of the actual Greek and Roman empires. This artwork was created later on in a comparable style.

            <h2>Classicism in Architecture</h2>
            <p>
                One of the most powerful manifestations of classicism was architecture. Greek temples and Roman public structures served as direct inspiration for the symmetry, columns, domes, and exact proportions used in building design.

            <h2>Classicism in Theatre</h2>
            <p>
                The "Three Unities"—one location, one time, and one main action—were stringent guidelines that classicist theatre adhered to. plays that emphasised morality, respect, and restrained emotion.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unity of Time:</strong> story occurs within 24 hours</li>
                <li><strong>Unity of Place:</strong> one setting</li>
                <li><strong>Unity of Action:</strong> no side plots</li>

            <p>
        The interiors of neoclassical theaters are physically structured around the "Three Unities" of Classical theatrical performance; the designs' symmetry and placement of the central stage, balcony, and audience create a single, unified performance space (Unity of Place) while the geometric control and symmetry create a direct line of sight to the on-going action within the theater (Unity of Action). The proportionate and controlled nature of the neoclassical theater design requires that the action occur in real-time as well as on a continuous basis, which reflects the classical ideal of a dramatic moment in itself (Unity of Time). Thus, the spatial arrangement of the neoclassical theaters and how they allow for and form the basis of the storytelling structure which epitomizes Classicist narratives represents a blending of moderation and balance that characterize all Classicist style storytelling.

                <h3>Jacques-Louis David</h3>
                <p>
                    Jacques-Louis David, the premier figure of the Neoclassical movement and one of the most important painters of the late eighteenth-and early nineteenth centuries, embodied many ideals expressed during the French Revolution while concentrating on ideals of moral virtue, civic responsibility, and rational clarity. David's rejection of the emotional excesses of Rococo was replaced with sharp geometry, carefully arranged compositional elements, and austere concepts that were influenced by the Roman Empire. Just as David's works, such as The Oath of the Horatii and The Death of Socrates, helped establish how western European nations would see and appreciate heroism and public duty, so too did David help establish the visual language of Classicism.

                <h3>Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres</h3>
                <p>
                    Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, a student of David, created a personal and polished style within the Classicism category. While David looked to create dramatic images relating to the politics of the day, Ingres aimed at painting non-political images filled with beauty, precision, and mathematical harmony. Ingres' portraits, including La Grande Odalisque, show evidence of elongation and an unusually smooth surface. Ingres emphasised the importance of elegance over anatomical accuracy in his works. He believed that drawing represented the basic element of Classical art and became known for producing meticulously controlled lines, which bridged the gap between Classicalism and later academic styles that influenced the generations that followed him.
