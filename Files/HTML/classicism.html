            <h2>Classicism in Architecture</h2>
            <p>
                Architecture was one of Classicism’s strongest expressions. Buildings were designed with 
                symmetry, columns, domes, and precise proportions inspired directly by Greek temples and 
                Roman public buildings.

            <h2>Classicism in Theatre</h2>
            <p>
                Classicist theatre followed strict rules known as the “Three Unities”: one place, one time, 
                one main action. Plays focused on moral lessons, dignity, and controlled emotion.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unity of Time:</strong> story occurs within 24 hours</li>
                <li><strong>Unity of Place:</strong> one setting</li>
                <li><strong>Unity of Action:</strong> no side plots</li>

                <p>
                    A leading figure of Neoclassical painting, David shaped the visual language of the French

                    Known for his precise linework and refined portraits, Ingres elevated Classicism into an 
                    elegant, almost mathematical style.
