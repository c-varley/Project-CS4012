<h2>Classicism: What is it?</h2>
    <p>

    The aesthetics and ideals of ancient Greece and Rome served as the inspiration for the classical art movement. But these aren't the artistic creations of the actual Greek and Roman empires. This artwork was created later on in a comparable style.

            <h2>Classicism in Architecture</h2>
            <p>
                One of the most powerful manifestations of classicism was architecture. Greek temples and Roman public structures served as direct inspiration for the symmetry, columns, domes, and exact proportions used in building design.

            <h2>Classicism in Theatre</h2>
            <p>
                The "Three Unities"—one location, one time, and one main action—were stringent guidelines that classicist theatre adhered to. plays that emphasised morality, respect, and restrained emotion.

                <li><strong>Unity of Time:</strong> story occurs within 24 hours</li>
                <li><strong>Unity of Place:</strong> one setting</li>
                <li><strong>Unity of Action:</strong> no side plots</li>
